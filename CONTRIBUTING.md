# Contributing to the _Lotus Server Stack_
Welcome! Happy to see that you're willing to make the project better.
Unfortunately at this time i have this closed off until it's in a stable
state and able to host [lotusroot.dev](https://lotusroot.dev/)

## current members
The [documentation](https://lotusroot.dev/docs/latest/contributing/)
contains details on all you need to know about contributing to _LSS_, the basics to
the internals of _LSS_.

I look forward to your contributions!
